Introduction to Relational Algebra and Relational Calculus
===========================================================

## Query Language

> 游릭 A language which is used to store and retrieve data from database is known as query language. For example : sql.

**There are two types of query language :**
1. Procedural Query Language

### Non-procedural

> 游릭 In Non-procedural query language, user instructs the system to produce the desired result without telling the step by step process.

## Relational Algebra

> 游릭 Relational algebra is a conceptual procedural query language used on relational model.

## Relational Calculus

> 游릭 Relational calculus is a conceptual non-procedural query langauge used on relational model.
