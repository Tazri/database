DBMS Relational Algebra
========================


**Types of Operations in Relational algebra :**

1. Basic Operations
2. Derived  Operations
    - Natural Join (⋈)
    - Left, Right, Full outer joint(⟕, ⟖, ⟗)
    - Intersection (∩)
    - Division (÷)

## Some DBMS Relational Algebra Operator

<details>
<summary>1. Select (σ)</summary>

> 🟢 Select Operator is denoted by sigma(σ) and it is used to find the tuples (or rows) in a relation(or table) which satisfy the given condition.

> 🟠 It's similar to `WHERE` clause in SQL.

**Syntax :**
```
σ Condition/Predicate(Relation/Table name)
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>2. Project Operator (∏)</summary>

> 🟢 This operator denoted by ∏ symbol and it is used to select desired columns (or attributes) from a table or relation.

> 🟠 It's similar to `SELECT` statement in SQL.

**Syntax :**
```
∏ column_name1, column_name2, ...., column_nameN(table_name)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Union Operator (∪)</summary>

> 🟢 Union operator is denoted by (∪) symbol and it is used to select all the rows from two tables.

**Syntax :**
```
table_name1 ∪ table_name2
```

**Example :**
```
∏ Student_Name (COURSE) ∪ ∏ Student_Name (STUDENT)
```
</details>


<details>
<summary>4. Intersection Operation (∩)</summary>

> 🟢 Intersection operator is denoted by ∩ symbol and it is used to select common rows from two tables.

**Syntax :**
```
table_name1 ∩ table_name2
```

**Example :**
```
∏ Student_Name (COURSE) ∩ ∏ Student_Name (STUDENT)
```

</details>


<details>
<summary>5. Set Difference (-)</summary>

> 🟢 Set difference is denoted by - symbol.

**Syntax :**
```
table_name1 - table_name2
```

**Example :**
```
∏ Student_Name (STUDENT) - ∏ Student_Name (COURSE)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>6. Cartesian Product (X)</summary>

> 🟢 Cartesian Product is denoted by X symbol.

**Syntax :**
```
R1 X R2
```

**Example :**
```
Table_R X Table_S
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>7. Rename (ρ)</summary>

> 🟢 Rename (ρ) operation can be used to rename a relation or an attributes of a relation.

**Syntax :**
```
ρ(new_relation_name,old_relation_name)
```
</details>
