## What is a RDBMS 
**RDBMS** = Realational + Database Management system. It is one kind of DBMS which can store the data from of tables, these tables are interconnected to each oter which helps in indentifyint the relation between the data stored in different tables.

## Difference between DBMS and RDBMS.

| DBMS            |  RDBMS                                         |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Data is stored in a files. | Data is stored in a tables.         |
| Dose not support Normalization | Suport Normalization which can reduces the data redundancy |
| Dosen't have a proper security. | RDBMS allows to set permissions on tables, which prevents unauthorised access. |
| Here no relation between the dtaa stored in different files. | RDBMS can have a relationship with other tables. |
| DBMS doesn't support distributed database. | RDBMS supports distributed database. |
| DBMS is suitable for small project. There is no need to scale the data in future. | RDBMS is suitable for large project where the size of the data is huge. |
| It support single user only. | It supports multiple users. |
| Examples are : XML, MS Access etc. | Examples are : IBM Db2, Oracle, MySQL etc. |
